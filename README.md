# BookStore_DataBase_app
A python program which can manage a book store database, it has the ablity to add, remove and search books.
The user can search by author, title, year, or ISBN code.
This program can run as a standalone, i.e. executable.

I used sqlite3 to manage the database quries,in addition i used "tkinter" package for the front end design
